The dashboard consists of tiles which are, under the hood, Livewire components. They can update themselves via polling. 

You can use any of the [pre-packaged tiles](/docs/laravel-dashboard/v2/adding-tiles/overview) or [create your own](/docs/laravel-dashboard/v2/adding-tiles/creating-your-own-tile).
